# SkipOOBE
Probably the best tool to skip the OOBE of Windows 10/11!
#New! GUI version! (requires .Net 6.0)
- Fixes Audit mode errors
- Skips OOBE when making an new account 
- One click skip.
# Windows 10:
First, make sure you didn't procced in the setup. Then press:
CTRL + SHIFT + F3 at the same time!

It will log you in into an Administrator account with some restrictions e.g. no system restore points.

If your running Windows 10 20H2, the best way to bypass the plague called Microsoft Edge is using "hh h".
Press:

WINDOWS + R to get the run program.

Then, type in "hh h".

Once you got the program, click on the icon and click "Jump to URL".

Put in the URL of this repo and head to the latest release

Download the latest release of SkipOOBE and then run it!

NOTE: If you need to use the Administrator account in future, delete the "delete.bat" in the startup folder!
# Windows 11
Same process except you must use Edge as Internet Explorer refuses to co-operate.
# What and Why?
SkipOOBE is a batch script made by me which helps you to skip the OOBE which collects too much data about you which is very unnecessary. I made this script becuase most tutorials might be seen as hard to follow and do. With my script, the hard work has already been done! Just press enter and make your account! Simple! This script also helps you save alot of time... look at the following video comparison!
